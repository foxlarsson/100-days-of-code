# 100 Days Of Code - Log

My format for the challenge is commiting at least 15 minutes for 100 days to working through Knothecode.io. 100 days wil. l be out on January 9th - or on February 18th if I count the weekends.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Finished Step 1 – A Gentle Introduction, Step 3 Introduction to Computation and Programming – Overview, Started Step 4 - Problem Solving Expression (did Step 2 - Setup Your Development Machine yesterday).

**Thoughts:** Seems like just the kind of foundation I've been struggling with finding. I don't know how code and web dev will relate to my art, but I hope at some point those two lines will merge.
