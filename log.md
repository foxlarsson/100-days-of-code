# 100 Days Of Code - Log

My format for the challenge is commiting at least 15 minutes for 100 days to working through Knothecode.io. 100 days wil. l be out on January 9th - or on February 18th if I count the weekends.

### Day 0: October 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Step 1 – A Gentle Introduction, Step 3 Introduction to Computation and Programming – Overview, Started Step 4 - Problem Solving Expression (did Step 2 - Setup Your Development Machine yesterday).

**Thoughts:** Seems like just the kind of foundation I've been struggling with finding. I don't know how code and web dev will relate to my art, but I hope at some point those two lines will merge.

### Day 1: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched Computational thinking and Computational visualization on KTC. (that's for the challenge part, probably about half an hour total). Other than that spent the whole day preparing the new deviz site for tomorrow's meeting which I then cancelled at the last moment, because I can't go two nights without sleep.
J ended up doing most of the work for the function to rewrite the People CPT title using ACF fields. I was tired and scared and frozen minded.

**Thoughts:** Seems like just the kind of foundation I've been struggling with finding. I don't know how code and web dev will relate to my art, but I hope at some point those two lines will merge.

### Day 2: October 3, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Watched:
  - Computational thinking: Pseudocode; => finished Step 4
  - Types of data: Lab introduction, Primitive Data Type, Composite Data Type, Special Data Type, Abstract Data Type; => finished Step 5
  - Building blocks of programming: Lab Introduction, User-Friendly Expression of Information, Fundamentals of Syntax, Decision branching - if/then/else, Decision branching - switch/case
 

**Thoughts:** 
It's a bit hard to focus today, I'm in a jittery state because my sleep cycle is very off, and the videos today don't require any actions, just focusing on the info. But I've managed to finish steps five anad six, and should be done with seven soon, and after that it gets more hands-on.

### Day 3: October 4, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Watched:
   - Building blocks of programming: Basics of Iteration, Order of Execution, Abstraction, Scoping – Who Can Communicate With Whom; => finished step 6.

**Thoughts:** 
So I've finished the steps of the beginner's track where I mostly listen and now need to decide whether I'm going to go through steps 7 and 8 on Codecademy, as recommended, or brush up on that stuff elsewhere. The courses there were initially recommended as free ones, but that is no longer the case for half of them. There is a one week trial period, so maybe if I try hard enough, I can manage to get through on time. I'm not worried about the html and css, but the JavaScript might put a spike or two in my wheels.
Also, I need to stop procrastinating my work project, so I'm pausing my studies for today. Two things I need to do: a brief outline of my websites for artists idea for the talk with N, and write up the function that will display employees and their details on the deviz contact pages.
