# 100 Days Of Code - Log

My format for the challenge is commiting at least 15 minutes for 100 days to working through Knothecode.io. 100 days wil. l be out on January 9th - or on February 18th if I count the weekends.

### Day 0: October 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Step 1 – A Gentle Introduction, Step 3 Introduction to Computation and Programming – Overview, Started Step 4 - Problem Solving Expression (did Step 2 - Setup Your Development Machine yesterday).

**Thoughts:** Seems like just the kind of foundation I've been struggling with finding. I don't know how code and web dev will relate to my art, but I hope at some point those two lines will merge.

### Day 1: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched Computational thinking and Computational visualization on KTC. (that's for the challenge part, probably about half an hour total). Other than that spent the whole day preparing the new deviz site for tomorrow's meeting which I then cancelled at the last moment, because I can't go two nights without sleep.
J ended up doing most of the work for the function to rewrite the People CPT title using ACF fields. I was tired and scared and frozen minded.

### Day 2: October 3, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Watched:
  - Computational thinking: Pseudocode; => finished Step 4
  - Types of data: Lab introduction, Primitive Data Type, Composite Data Type, Special Data Type, Abstract Data Type; => finished Step 5
  - Building blocks of programming: Lab Introduction, User-Friendly Expression of Information, Fundamentals of Syntax, Decision branching - if/then/else, Decision branching - switch/case
 

**Thoughts:** 
It's a bit hard to focus today, I'm in a jittery state because my sleep cycle is very off, and the videos today don't require any actions, just focusing on the info. But I've managed to finish steps five anad six, and should be done with seven soon, and after that it gets more hands-on.

### Day 3: October 4, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Watched:
   - Building blocks of programming: Basics of Iteration, Order of Execution, Abstraction, Scoping – Who Can Communicate With Whom; => finished step 6.

**Thoughts:** 
So I've finished the steps of the beginner's track where I mostly listen and now need to decide whether I'm going to go through steps 7 and 8 on Codecademy, as recommended, or brush up on that stuff elsewhere. The courses there were initially recommended as free ones, but that is no longer the case for half of them. There is a one week trial period, so maybe if I try hard enough, I can manage to get through on time. I'm not worried about the html and css, but the JavaScript might put a spike or two in my wheels.
Also, I need to stop procrastinating my work project, so I'm pausing my studies for today. Two things I need to do: a brief outline of my websites for artists idea for the talk with N, and write up the function that will display employees and their details on the deviz contact pages.

### Day 4: October 5, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Zoomed through the 24 levels of Flexbox Froggy to refresh Flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** 
Needed Flexbox for my work project (the employee profiles and contact information are displayed on cards that it makes sense to use Flexbox with). Then spent most of the night fixing the AAA plugin for bark. But in truth saying J. did most of the work is an understatement. Though my basic idea was true, I could never have figured out the kink that was in the way without him. But I learned a lot watching him work, problem solve and troubleshoot.

### Day 5: October 6, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Got through three rounds of Flexbox Zombies. 

**Thoughts:** 
The Beginner track says to brush up on html, css and basic javascript before going further, and flexbox is one of those things that I can't get to comfortably using without looking stuff up in the manual constantly. And since I'll be building a few Flexbox-based layouts on the deviz website this week and the coming one, I thought it made sense to get Flexbox to an automatic level, so I don't have to think about it or look it up constantly.
Other than that writing up my monthly report for deviz, need that thing done by morning. As I was writing it, I discovered that I'd lost the half the work I'd done on the job opening page templates. I still have the css, but my php templates are gone (my bad, lost them while reinstalling Local). I am hoping to get comfortable using Git within the coming couple of weeks so something like that never happens again.

Also wrote up the basics of the program for the Websites for Artists project K. and I will be doing. That's not part of my studies, but it's part of me both as an artist, and a developer, so it's important.

### Day 6: October 7, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Rounds 4-5 of Flexbox Zombies (align-self, flex-grow). 
Lambda school Precourse: Introduction to web development fundamentals.
Lambda school Precourse: Introduction to HTML.

**Thoughts:** 
I found out that Lambda school ISA is unavailable in Russia halfway through the application process. That makes perfect sense, really, why would it be, but I was really upset. For a moment I felt like maybe I didn't have to go through this alone. The structure and the mentoring and the support were such an appealing prospect. But obviously there's no world in which I can afford the $20k payment without the ISA. 
I decided to go through the Precourse either way. It has all the things I need to refresh for Know the Code, so it's as good a place as any.

Made some progress on the websites for artists program with K. Finished the report for work but didn't find it in me to redo the lost template, mostly because I was unwell from the erratic sleep (and lack thereof). Planning to get up in an hour or so and get that done.

Got some drawing done (even with the studies and work and the sleep|non sleep thing).

### Day 7: October 8, 2019
 
**Today's Progress**: 
Rounds 6-7 of Flexbox Zombies (flex-shrink and flex-basis). 
Lambda school Precourse: Introduction to CSS.
Know the Code: Simply Git: Lab introduction, The Big Picture, 3 Locals - Working, Staging & Storage.

**Thoughts:** 
It's a bit hard to eyeball the ratios for the shrinking/growing zombies, so with this round a lot of the time I have to try over and over again to get it right. I get the principle, but keep estimating the values wrong.

I rewrote my lost templates today, and I was much faster and better this time, and I think my code was cleaner too.  Went over what I need to write up my online store proposal for D. Writing that in the morning. 

Watched the free part (first three videos) of the Simply Git lab on KTC, hoping to start using version control within a week. At least in a very basic way.

It's impressive how much the zombie game is helping me with the Flexbox logic, it really made putting together the new template a lot easier.

I am writing here both about study and work, because the two end up being intertwined. Also managed to finish another square pic today.
