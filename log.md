# 100 Days Of Code - Log

My format for the challenge is commiting at least 15 minutes for 100 days to working through Knothecode.io. 100 days wil. l be out on January 9th - or on February 18th if I count the weekends.

### Day 0: October 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Step 1 – A Gentle Introduction, Step 3 Introduction to Computation and Programming – Overview, Started Step 4 - Problem Solving Expression (did Step 2 - Setup Your Development Machine yesterday).

**Thoughts:** Seems like just the kind of foundation I've been struggling with finding. I don't know how code and web dev will relate to my art, but I hope at some point those two lines will merge.

### Day 1: October 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched Computational thinking and Computational visualization on KTC. (that's for the challenge part, probably about half an hour total). Other than that spent the whole day preparing the new deviz site for tomorrow's meeting which I then cancelled at the last moment, because I can't go two nights without sleep.
J ended up doing most of the work for the function to rewrite the People CPT title using ACF fields. I was tired and scared and frozen minded.

**Thoughts:** Seems like just the kind of foundation I've been struggling with finding. I don't know how code and web dev will relate to my art, but I hope at some point those two lines will merge.
